 Day 104 Lockdown. Dianne Blaauw (left) walked over to chat with Elizabeth Fourie and Bridgette Frolick who were enjoying the sun while their washing dried overhead. They knew that cold fronts were approaching the Cape and had done all their remaining laundry which, with small children in the house, is a constant chore. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
