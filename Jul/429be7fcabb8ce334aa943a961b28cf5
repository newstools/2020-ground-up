 Day 114 Lockdown. Every year on Mandela Day, the ladies from the Muizenberg Craft Care group hand out the beanies and scarves they have been knitting and crocheting throughout the year. Usually nearby Thesenâ€™s Bridge is adorned with their knitwear, but this year they decided to join Muizenberg CAN, who distribute hot meals from the Blue Bird Garage daily. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
