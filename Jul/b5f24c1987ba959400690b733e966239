 Day 123 Lockdown. Bill Bulgen very strictly uses only natural sustainable material and plant-based epoxies to hand craft beautiful wooden surfboards. His material of choice is traditional Chinese boatbuilding wood, Paulownia, which he imports because it is light, strong and naturally water resistant. A retired construction carpenter, he started the first board out of curiosity eight years ago and has since won awards for his work. Lockdown has put a dent in his sales, but since he works from home he is happy to use the time to experiment with new designs. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
