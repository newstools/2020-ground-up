 Day 117 Lockdown. If life with a son who uses tik is normally difficult, it is impossible under lockdown conditions. Her son, now in his 20s, has stolen every small appliance, sellable possession and even some of the electrical wiring in their home. She has been to numerous social workers for help, but in the end she laid criminal charges against him. He is not supposed to be near the house, but still comes to ask for food, which is difficult for any mother to refuse. The doors and windows are barricaded to keep him out, because he becomes violent when he does not get his way. The court appearance is tomorrow, maybe that will bring some peace. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
