 Day 99 Lockdown. Christine van der Werf takes her time rolling her smoke. Although cigarettes have always been available in spite of the ban, the high prices put them out of her reach. Now that costs are down to between R3 and R5 an ‘entjie’, she can afford one a day. This she crushes and mixes with other tobaccos to make two cigarettes, one for the morning and the other for later.
