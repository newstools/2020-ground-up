 Day 108 Lockdown. Ncebakazi Makinana lives in Monwabisi Park, just off Baden Powell Drive. Residents used to fetch water from areas with communal taps - which involved a very long walk - or rainwater from a much nearer hole in the ground which, said Makinana, was usable for some purposes. At the beginning of lockdown things improved when a tanker brought water twice a day. Now tanks have been installed. For her, the biggest hardship by far has been not being able to see her relatives.
