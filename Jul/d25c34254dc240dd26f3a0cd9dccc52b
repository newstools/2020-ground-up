 Day 101 Lockdown. It was good to see activity at the food court of the Blue Route Mall, although it was not nearly as busy as it used to be on the first Sunday of the month. Most of the traffic was for take-aways or deliveries, for which there was a steady stream of customers, but there were also those who wanted a sit-down meal and were prepared to endure the screening process. Waiter Cyril Lisa from Retreat was certainly not complaining. This is his only source of income and he was just happy to be back at work again. Photo: Jeffrey Abrahams.
