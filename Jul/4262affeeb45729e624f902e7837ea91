Khumalo who lives in Mndozo village in Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal, used to have to relieve herself in a roofless pit latrine with broken walls. Hearing of her plight, Amalooloo Toilets got in touch with Ward 7 Councillor Bawinile Khumalo, who said she had the issue sorted. A toilet for Gogo Khumalo was built on the councillor’s instruction on Monday 29 June. On Thursday 2 July, Amalooloo arrived and built two more toilets, another for Khumalo and one for her neighbour, Muziwendoda Zungu, who is 69 and still on a waiting list for a toilet. The lane to Khumalo’s new toilet has been paved with concrete tiles for comfortable access. It has basins inside and out, a rainwater tank and a solar-powered light. “May God bless you all and your company for helping the needy,” Nokuthula Khumalo, Khumalo’s daughter-in-law, told Amalooloo project manager Petrus Bambo.
