 Day 116 Lockdown. Finally the development of District Six is going ahead. As excavators clear the upper substrate the outlines of the original buildings and streets are being revealed, like this section which still has remnants of a boiler in the basement. There is also a area of cobbled paving which archaeologists have dated to the 1840s. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
