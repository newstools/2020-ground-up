 Day 107 Lockdown. Brothers Luvuyo and Monwabisi Qwabi live on Oscar Mpetha Road in Khayelitsha. Their front door opens onto the pavement, so in the absence of a yard they created this nook which faces passing traffic. Local artists from Storyroom Creatives turned their home into a sign which proudly declares “We Love Khayelitsha”. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
