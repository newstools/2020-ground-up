 Day 120 Lockdown. Masakhane Educare has an enrolment of 160, a staff of ten, and is a beacon of light in Masiphumelele. Grade R teacher Faith Madikane was at school to prepare for the return of 61 Grade Rs on 3 August, but following the President’s announcement on Thursday night, this is not going to happen. The centre is also governed by the Department of Social Development, which to the relief of many in the community had said it could reopen its crèche. This too, is now uncertain.
