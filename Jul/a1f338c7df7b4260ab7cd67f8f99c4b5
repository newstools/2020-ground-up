 Day 126 Lockdown. For the past three months Nozipho Maphi and Zukiswa Mendisi have been selling new and used clothes from their place in Nkandla, Khayelitsha. With trains being cancelled, there was simply no trade at their stall at the normally busy station at Site C. The number of houses being built on the fields around them are increasing daily, which theyâ€™re sure can only be good for their business. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
