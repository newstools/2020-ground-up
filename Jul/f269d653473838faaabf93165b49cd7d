 Day 109 Lockdown. In storms, the sensible thing to do is to take shelter. However, the adventurous, the curious and those who did not mind getting wet and dirty were drawn to the Sea Point Promenade by the promise of heavy seas and strong winds with waves thundering against the rocks. Sections of Three Anchor Bay were hidden beneath clingy foam which covered everything â€“ and drew the largest crowds. Everyone soon discovered that their compulsory masks were very handy at keeping the flying foam out of their mouths. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
