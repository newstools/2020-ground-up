 Day 127 Lockdown. Young chef Sebastian Stehr has always dreamed of having his own bakery. When lockdown regulations closed the restaurant where he worked, it forced him into taking the plunge. He now bakes on demand in a converted garage at his home in Lakeside, from where he delivers sourdough breads, croissants and speciality products. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
