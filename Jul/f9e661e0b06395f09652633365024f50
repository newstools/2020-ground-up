 Day 124 Lockdown. Chauke Jones and Quinton Baron have been selling fish at the corner of Baden Powell and Strandfontein Road for two years. They sometimes feel vulnerable as they are exposed to the elements and passing traffic, but they love what they do and take pride in their work. As Baron says, unless youâ€™re passionate about it, constantly removing scales, gutting and cleaning fish is not for everyone. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
