 Day 98 Lockdown. As Covid-19 infections rise, the voices which want schools to close are becoming more strident. Some posters along Prince George Drive this morning declared it murderous to open schools, others said deceased teachers have names and families and should not be reduced to statistics. Teachers, parents and learners present vow to oppose authorities, who remain adamant that schooling should proceed. Photo: Jeffrey Abrahams. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown
