 Day 112 Lockdown. Finally, after a few months this pavement is tarred over. It had been excavated, fibre optic cables laid, then filled in and compacted. Not for the first time. The same thing had happened last year for a different network. This time though, just before it was to be re-surfaced, a different crew moved in - the Ciy of Cape Town - and so the whole process started all over. We almost expect shoddy workmanship these days, but my untrained eye was impressed with this particular crew. They were efficient, cohesive as a team, and took note of the minor details. We now have a lovely two-tone sidewalk.
