 Day 125 Lockdown. Sharon Simango keeps her husband Thomas company in his tiny workroom in Masiphumelele, where he does alterations and repairs to clothing. His sewing machine, a Toyota, was a gift from a repair shop when they couldnâ€™t fix his old one. His father taught him to sew at an early age and much like his father, Thomas also uses the space to work as a cobbler and a barber. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
