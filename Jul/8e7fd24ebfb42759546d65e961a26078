 Day 102 Lockdown. Brothers Akhona and Uminathi Tgcebesha help Lutho Mayo (left) clear weeds from his plot in Endlovini, Khayeltisha. Although he lives alone, Lutho is concerned about Covid-19. He has to take two taxis to get to Brackenfell where he works for a supermarket. Whether going or returning from work, he feels especially exposed on the taxis which he says do not take the regulations seriously at all. Photo: Jeffrey Abrahams.
