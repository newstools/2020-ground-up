 Day 122 Lockdown. Adam Kiewiets returns from church to his home in Bonnytoun. His church has suspended worship services and like many others it sends recorded messages to the congregation, but a few members gather in the church hall on Sundays and watch these together. This morning was the first time he attended and he was pleased he had done so. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
