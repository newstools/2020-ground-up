 Day 100 Lockdown. I saw this bicycle frame at Opperman’s Oordt, Strandfontein, and thought it had been discarded. Instead, it belonged to four year old Miciah Fisher and he still derives great joy from it. While the other kids were queueing excitedly to receive the beanies, gloves and oranges that Carmen Davids and Pearle Jenneker spent their Saturday morning handing out, he picked it up and was soon running up and down, pushing it all over the show. Much of it is either missing or broken but his mother says it’s still his favourite toy. Photo: Jeffrey Abrahams. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown
