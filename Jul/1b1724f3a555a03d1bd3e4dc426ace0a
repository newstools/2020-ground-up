 Day 111 Lockdown. Niyaaz Salie, 12, runs with Hackney horse Pop Star after a training session in Schaapkraal. When his great-grandfather was forced to move from Constantia under apartheid, the family took their love of horses to Grassy Park where they now live. Niyaaz hopes to follow in the steps of his uncle Jallodien, owner of Pop Star, and his grandfather Dawood Samuels, who was a seven times SA champ with Hackney horses.
