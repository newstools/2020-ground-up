Cape Town’s main roads were eerily quiet on Friday morning, the first day of the three-week lockdown ordered by President Cyril Ramaphosa to suppress the Covid-19 epidemic. Both the police and the army are enforcing the lockdown. The Department of Transport issued a statement saying that 22,347 traffic officers have been deployed across the country to “ensure compliance with the published regulations”.  Cape Town city centre was mostly quiet this morning. There were only security personnel and a few people on the streets. Most stores were closed except spaza shops and a spice shop.
