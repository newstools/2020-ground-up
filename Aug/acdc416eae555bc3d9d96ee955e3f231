 Day 157 Lockdown. This section of the Maitland cemetery has been reserved for Covid-related graves and has a capacity of 5,000 plots. Fortunately, demand has not been as high as projected. Cemeteries are particularly busy on Saturdays, but today there was one addition to the fresh graves in this section. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
