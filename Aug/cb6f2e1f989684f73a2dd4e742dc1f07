 Day 149 Lockdown. Calim Abrahams canâ€™t wait to go back to school on Monday and asked his dad Cheslin to cut his hair. As a Grade 4 pupil he has been at home since the state of disaster was declared in March. His parents did their best to provide schooling, and the school supplied some work, but he said it was not the same. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
