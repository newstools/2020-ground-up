 Day 133 Lockdown. Ismail Southgate refers to himself as a recycler. He takes the materials he collects from bins to his home in Military Heights, where he sorts them into hard and soft plastic, white paper, iron and tin cans. It does not generate much income, but he says he’s proud that it’s an honest living. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
