 Day 148 Lockdown. Women from St Patrick and Langeberg Streets in Hillview gather on the corner to catch the last rays of the day and keep an eye on the toddlers and the other children of the area who are running up and down and playing in the street. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
