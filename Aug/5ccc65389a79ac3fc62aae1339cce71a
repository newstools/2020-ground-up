 Day 148 Lockdown. Women from St Patrick and Langeberg Streets in Hillview gather on the corner to catch the last rays of the day. Actually, theyâ€™re keeping an eye on the toddlers and the other children of the area who are running up and down and playing in the street. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
