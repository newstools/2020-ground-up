 Day 140 Lockdown. Covid-19 infections in Khayelitsha are on the decline, with Dr Keith Cloete, head of the Western Cape Department of Health, saying new infections have gone down almost fivefold per week. So much so, that the MSF field hospital has been decommissioned. Taking the socio-economic conditions into account, the success of the multi-sectoral approach adopted by the community is remarkable. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
