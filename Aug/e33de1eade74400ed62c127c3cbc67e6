 Day 135 Lockdown. Kholelwa Yonana from Bonnytoun hadn’t realised it was Women’s Day. For her it was just another day. She worked as a home carer but has been unemployed since April when the elderly person she had looked after died. Since then, one day has just blended into the next as she does her best to look after her household and her family. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
