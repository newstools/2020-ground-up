 Day 134 Lockdown. Natitia Avontuur and her group of volunteer Covid ambassadors make their way down St Peter Street in Hillview. They do general Covid education in the area south of Military Road and make sure that people are masked and distancing appropriately, especially at spaza shops. While theyâ€™re patrolling they also keep a lookout for water and sewage leaks. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
