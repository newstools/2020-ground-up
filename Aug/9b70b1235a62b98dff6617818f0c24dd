 Day 153 Lockdown. Crammed into backyards all across the Cape Flats, like here in Acacia Road, Parkwood, are the homes of many families who have nowhere else to stay. It is mostly relatives who take them in and because their dwellings are not visible from the street, they often refer to themselves as invisible, forgotten people. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
