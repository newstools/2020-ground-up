 Day 139 Lockdown. Masiphumelele residents brave the drizzle to fetch water. Many who use the water tanker live in yards where their landlords limit the amount of water they can use. There are communal taps further down the road, but because thereâ€™s no drainage the areas around those are mostly muddy and the taps are unpleasant to use. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
