 Day 138 Lockdown. Charles Mathlay is well known for the green haven he has created at his home in St Peter Avenue, Military Heights. A pruner and groundsman at a large residential development, he is never off duty as he brings his work home with him. Besides an area set aside for vegetables, he uses his garden to experiment with cuttings and new methods which he can implement at work. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
