 Day 151 Lockdown. Lovemore Makuyana and his team are specialists who work on traffic lights. During the higher levels of lockdown they replaced only three that had been hit by cars. When restrictions were relaxed and traffic increased, so did the damage. Then the ban on alcohol was lifted; last week alone they had to replace four. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
