 Day 147 Lockdown. Neighbours Charmaine Simon and Lucy Swartz step out onto the pavement of Acacia Road, Parkwood to chat and to check on each other. With them is Kasiefa Sadick, who stays in Lucyâ€™s yard. Living in such close proximity, they regard themselves as one extended family. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
