 Day 137 Lockdown. Innocent Zungu earns a living from his sand sculptures. At the moment however, he says, his home town of St Lucia, is ‘dead’. With a family to provide for, he jumped on a bus and arrived in Cape Town a few days ago. He gave today’s sculpture on Muizenberg beach a Women’s Day theme. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
