 Day 128 Lockdown. Instead of the customary celebrations with relatives and friends, Ziyaan and Mariam Gamieldien and Fatima Kafaar today celebrated Eid quietly at home with their families. Regardless of the occasion, Bruno was not going to be denied his daily walk. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
