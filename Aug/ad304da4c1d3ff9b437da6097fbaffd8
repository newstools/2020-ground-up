 Day 141 Lockdown. It’s easier to be in a good mood on Fridays and lockdown hasn’t changed that. Margo Habelgaarn, Sedicka van Schalkwyk, little Tashreeq Jacobs and Malcolm Daniels from Village Heights enjoy spending much of their days together, but would really like to go back to school. This photo is part of a series on Cape Town under lockdown.
