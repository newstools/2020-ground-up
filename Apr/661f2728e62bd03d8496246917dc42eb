Wolverivier is located about 25km north of Cape Town city centre. It is one of the Cityâ€™s Temporary Relocation Areas, although there is nothing temporary about it: the first residents moved here in July 2015. With the lockdown, many residents are unable to work and children are relying on feeding schemes for food.
