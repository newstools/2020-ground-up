Walkways and roads across the Cape Flats have turned into pools. In Qandu Qandu informal settlement in Khayelitsha some residents had to leave their flooded homes.  Residents have had to temporarily abandon some of these shacks in Qandu Qandu. They are hoping to get assistance from the City of Cape Town.
